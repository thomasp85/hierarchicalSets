\title{Hierarchical analysis and visualization of set data}
\description{
This package provides a framework for investigating large scale set data with
the use of hierarchical clustering. While hierarchical clustering has been
employed on set data numerous times, by converting the presence/absence
matrix to a distance matrix and using \code{\link[stats:hclust]{stats::hclust()}}, this
approach completely removes any notion of underlying set structure from the
data. hierarchicalSets instead performs a clustering directly using set
algebra by continuously merging sets with the largest intersection (for ties
the one with the smallest union is chosen). This structure can then be used
in a variety of ways to visualize the relationships between sets. E.g. the
intersectionStack plot is a scalable pendant to Venn diagrams (showing the
same information but using a different visual mapping).
